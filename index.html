        <h1>Where they Migrate</h1>
            <p>During the winter, clusters of orange wings cover the trees in Monarch butterfly groves in <em>Pismo Beach, Nipomo, Los Osos and Morro Bay. </em> In fact, researchers have counted up to 230,000 Monarch butterflies in a single season at the Pismo State Beach Butterfly Grove. As the weather warms in spring, the butterflies begin migrating north. Western Monarchs can travel over 1,000 miles to reach their next migration point. Western Monarchs live west of the Rockies and migrate up and down the West Coast, between southern Canada and San Diego. Eastern Monarchs, on the other hand, live east of the Rocky Mountains and migrate south each winter to Mexico. A sunny winter day offers ideal conditions to see Monarch butterflies along Highway 1. Monarch butterflies become active when the sun hits their wings. Appropriately enough, mating season reaches its peak near Valentine’s Day ― an animated time at Monarch butterfly groves, indeed! Prepare for a spectacular natural spectacle by bringing water, sunscreen, a jacket, binoculars and comfortable shoes. Use the Coastal Discovery Trail to help plan your itinerary and make the most out of your Monarch viewing road trip.</p>

        <h2>What Can I Do?</h2>    
            <ul>
                <li>“Migration takes a ton of energy out of these butterflies, the best thing you can do for them is <strong>make sure they have access to lots of nectar plants</strong> to snack on along the way."</li>
                <li>“Also, being sure to <strong>plant lots of pesticide-free milkweed</strong>plant lots of pesticide-free milkweed in the spring will make sure these guys have the healthiest start to their lives and will positively impact the whole four-generation-long migration cycle.”</li>
